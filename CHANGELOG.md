# Changelog

All notable changes to scolta-core will be documented in this file.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Major versions are synchronized across all Scolta packages.

## [Unreleased] (0.2.0-dev)

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Removed server-side Extism/WASI target entirely — scolta-core is now browser-only WASM
- Removed `clean_html` and `build_pagefind_html` (ported to pure PHP in scolta-php)
- Removed `debug_call` (server-side profiling tool)
- Removed feature flags (`extism`/`browser`) — single target, no flags needed
- Removed `extism-pdk` and `regex` dependencies
- WASM interface version bumped to 2

### Added

- 8 wasm-bindgen exports: `score_results`, `merge_results`, `parse_expansion`, `resolve_prompt`, `get_prompt`, `to_js_scoring_config`, `version`, `describe`
- `to_js_scoring_config` passes through `AI_LANGUAGES` array for frontend multilingual support
- Search scoring algorithm with recency decay (exponential half-life), title/content match boosting, and expanded-term weight decay
- Result merging with Jaccard deduplication and configurable primary/expanded weight split
- HTML cleaner that strips page chrome and extracts main content
- Pagefind-compatible HTML builder with data attributes
- Prompt template system with `expand_query`, `summarize`, and `follow_up` templates and variable resolution
- LLM expansion response parser supporting JSON, markdown, and plain-text fallback formats
- Self-documenting `describe()` function catalog for runtime discovery
- `debug_call` profiling wrapper with timing and size metrics
- OnceLock-cached regex compilation for HTML processing
- Typed error enum with function-name attribution
- Shared stop words and term extraction utilities
